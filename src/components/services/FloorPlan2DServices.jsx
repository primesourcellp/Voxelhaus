              At Voxelhaus consultancy, we specialize in creating precise and professional 2D floor plan redraws that provide a clear and accurate representation of a property's layout.

              Why 2D Floor Plan Redraw Matters
            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-center">
              A 2D floor plan redraw acts as the foundation of any architectural or real estate project. It visually explains how rooms are connected, where entrances and windows are located, and how the property flows from one space to another. Unlike complex technical drawings, a simple 2D redraw is easy for clients, buyers, and stakeholders to understand.
